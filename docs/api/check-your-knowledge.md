# Check Your Knowledge

Looking for a fun way to learn about the Kroger Co.'s Public APIs? We've created a Knowledge Check to help you! Once you've completed the activity, you should have a basic understanding of how to authorize for access to the APIs and understand several of the Public APIs available.

## Setup
Complete the following steps before moving onto the knowledge check questions:

1. Download and install the Postman App. If you'd like to code this challenge directly, skip this step since you won't need Postman.
2. Create an account on the Developer Marketplace if you do not already have one. Just click on the "Sign In" link in the upper right and follow the instructions to get your account created.
3. Now that you have created an account and logged in, create an application. Creating an application provides the credentials you need to access to the Public APIs, even if you don't yet have an application started. For instructions, visit the Applications help page. When creating your application select the following:
   - Environment: Production
   - API Products: Check All
4. Get the Kroger Co. Public APIs set up with Postman by following these instructions.

## Questions
These questions are presented in order of difficulty, so don't be surprised if the last one is harder than the first!

For help with these questions, use the following resources:
- Kroger Public APIs Specification to learn what the contracts for the available Public APIs are.
- Use, view the tutorials and guides in the other sections of this Public APIs Documentation.

If you're ready to get started, the questions are as follows:

1. How many different chains does Kroger have?
2. How many locations have a pharmacy and a gas station near the zip code 45202?
3. How many Kroger brand milk products are available for ship to home for the following location ID: 01400751?
4. Get the aisle and shelf number for Gatorade Frost Thirst Quencher at the Kroger on the Rhine location (zip code 45202).
5. Get the name and street address of each location for the zip code 45202?

## Hints
Are you having problems with the questions? Here are some hints to make your life easier:

### General hints:
- What Authorization Grant Type are you using? If you're not using Client Credentials already, give that a try.
- Do you have the correct credentials from your application and the correct scope? Double check those if you're having issues.
- If you expect many results, consider limiting the number of items that can be returned.

### Postman-specific:
- Do you have the correct Postman environment downloaded? Have you updated it with your client credentials?
- Are you sick of counting the number of results in Postman? Think about using Postman test scripts to count these for you.
